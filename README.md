This project was developed using React with lifecycle methods along with AJAX calls to enable single page responsiveness.

Lukes Beer allows users to search the Brewery Database, 'like' and 'meh' beers.

Brewery Database API (http://www.brewerydb.com/developers/docs) does not allow CORS on free access accounts. In order to preview this project please disable CORS in Google Chrome using the following extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en 

Things to improve include: 
- Refactoring App.js.
- Using dotenv to hide API key.
- Using a workaround to override CORS.

This project intends to showcase abilities of state management and lifecycle components.

I am mostly responsible for frontend aspect (UI/UX) using Semantic and the Gsap library to enable transitions.

* Getting started

+ Assuming you have Node Package Manager (NPM) installed

run 

- `git clone git@github.com:carlosalmonte04/lukes-beer.git`

-	`cd lukes-beer`

- `npm install && npm start`

- The webapp will show but search will be not be functional. To enable please use Chrome and download the extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en to allow for CORS. * Remember to disable the extension after using Lukes Beer as other websites -e.g., Youtube, will not work.

Thanks for stopping by!
